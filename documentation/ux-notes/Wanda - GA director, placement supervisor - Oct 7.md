**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re reviewing so we can see whether they work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the sites, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.   First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

I am a social service supervisor.  I supervise a foster care unit.  And my awesome staff have anywhere from 15-25 children that they are responsible for obtaining permanency.  That includes everything - they pick them up and take them to the doctors, attend court hearings, roundtables, FTMs.  In GA, about 15 years ago, a child was killed in foster care, and that family sued the state of GA, its called the Kenneth A legis, DeKalb and Fulton 2 largest metro counties would handle the lawsuit and do whatever the lawsuit said.  We have lots of oversight.  Many outside agencies to make sure that our kids get everything they need in a timely manner.  Ours really do.  We have people who are Kenny A specialists.  Lots of reports and numbers, this is a good and bad thing.  There is a lot of stress in our counties - we have amazing oversight.  If the child must see a doctor in 30 days, on the 31st day, there are a ton of alerts and questions, about why did this happen?

The staff here have great expectations.  A Lot of people transfer out to other counties that are not as stressful.

I have to negotiate up and down - I’m the middle person.  

*Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

80% of the time.  I use a lot.  It could be 100% if I looked at it all day.  My email is on my phone. I have an agency telephone that’s on 24 hours a day.  It’s a smartphone.

*Any favourite sites?*

For the job, SHINES.  That’s has everything. Our email.  

I play all the time- outside of work, I facebook, google, all kinds of stuff and websites.  PInterest, Youtube. Kartwheel for Target.  App for the bible on my phone, my beautician stylesheets.

**Site Script:**

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.  **Let’s imagine our scenario is that you are a social worker who is trying to place a child with foster parents who need daycare in order to accept the placement.*

* First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

* *I need to zoom in.  We zoom.  She’s going to go to the magnifying glass.  I like that I can put in the zipcode or address of foster home.  I would have spoken to the foster mom first - where does she want daycare, near home or job.  Here in GA, I already know her name and address and phone number, because placement unit will have given it to me.  I will already have talked to her on the phone.

We commonly have to find daycare for the fosterparents.  New foster parents definitely.  Ones who have been around - we definintely need them.  For relatives.  About 90% of them we need to find the daycare.  Some grandmas haven’t had the need for daycare or what a good one even is.  We have to visit the daycares, we can tell them which ones are and aren’t good.

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?*

Yes, see above.

*Where are you likely to be when you are doing this search?*

Both in office and or actually at the relative or foster parents’ home.  If Ms Smith has her kids at the house and no idea of a daycare, our phone is connected to the internet, the worker could put Ms Smiths zipcode in.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next site.  This page is interactive, so you can use your mouse to move around and interact.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

The screen (map has no pins) - my initial reaction is this is awful.  I was looking for a list of them of names of the daycare centers not just a location

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

I like narrow your search.  What type of daycare I want - Do you know how to filter?

Yes. I want a non-relative in-home.

Is the info in the list useful - yes, I would like one that is rated.

*Is there anything that stands out as particularly helpful to your search? (map?hide/no,)*

*What are you interested in finding out (when you make the call)?*

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

After I find one, I would look to see the ratings, see the hours, do they provide transport, do they pick kids of from school, late policy.  Do they provide breakfast and lunch,  Are there daycare staff certified.  Does it allow us to have a picture.  Are there cameras in the ceiling, is the door secure, do people sign in or show badge.  I would also make a phone call.

*Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

More than one.

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*
