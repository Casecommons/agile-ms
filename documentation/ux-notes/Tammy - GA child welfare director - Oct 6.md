**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using 2 Web sites that we’re reviewing so we can see whether they work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the sites, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.   First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

I just changed jobs - our state level placement and permanency services director.  Previously regional director for region 4, 12 county office.  

The placement and permanency service job is the overall director for all things permanency.  For private providers, for working with foster parents, reunification, adoption, relative, all those programs.  Regional director has management oversight over county offices.  Supervise those county directors.  Child protective services forward

*Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

*For work - or even at home - A lot of time 40 or 50 hours a week.  I am usually on my laptop or telephone.  I have a work and personal telephone.  Work telephone HTC smartphone.  *

*Any favourite sites?*

*I will typically use things like child welfare information gateway, north american council for ad, kidscount, casey website.*

**Site Script:**

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.  **Let’s imagine our scenario is that you are a social worker who is trying to place a child with foster parents who need daycare in order to accept the placement.*

* 	First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

* *

I would enter the zipcode from where I live, so I could see what daycare options I might have available.

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?*

Yes. I would.

*Where are you likely to be when you are doing this search?*

As a case manager, I could be in the office or I could be in the field at the foster parents house.  I could be in a training.  I could be at another clients house, or starbucks.  Possibly doing it on a cellphone or laptop.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

That’s a great way - because you don’t need to scroll to or figure out how to get to a specific search for your area.  A couple of ways I would think might be able to narrow down, I think of city of Atlanta zipcode would come up with a lot of results.  I’m thinking you would see this when you got further in, if I was looking for a daycare for special needs.

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next site.  This page is interactive, so you can use your mouse to move around and interact.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

I see the map and the two little people and I assume this is where the daycare is located. I would probably zoom into where the daycare was located.  I am assuming Jennifer D-R would be a possible daycare.   I would click to learn more.  

I don’t know what the terminology means.  However there is a question mark - I would use that to find out.  Unless I was in the agency and knew.  For example I’m much more likely to understand term.  What does the rating mean and what does it consist of.

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

*Is there anything that stands out as particularly helpful to your search? (map?hide/no,)*

The map is helpful, because you can zoom in and tell how close or far that center might be from your house.  If the ratings were there, I like having the phone number, and call them.

*What are you interested in finding out (when you make the call)?*

Do they have any openings?  What type of children do they accept (age range)?  Learn more about the demographics about the other kids there?  What are their hours?  Extended hours - how early or late?  Then I would get a little more into what do they eat, what does the kids day look like, supervision, centers based daycare, etc.

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

*Either make a phone call or click on the person’s name and see what other info I can get.  I’d rather look on the website.*

*Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

I am looking for more than one.

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  

For purposes of our policies and financial, no.  For work purposes no.  Because we wouldn’t be able to pay them. 

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*

If I’m the case manager, I would likely ask a peer or supervisor in the county about what good ones they have experience with.  I would ask our child care unit.  Hoping to find something.  Probably something else I would do - I could ask my foster parent if they are familiar with any relative or a daycare they’ve used in the past.

If there was a home screen or a drop down menu, I would see what other things the website might be able to help me with.

Special needs - is there anyway for me to look at who can care for that child?  

Love the idea - case management staff are very tech savvy.  They would love this.  They can get to info very fast.  They would love it if the payment processing was connected.  They would love a one stop shop.  They would want to make the recommendation and set up payment at the same time.
