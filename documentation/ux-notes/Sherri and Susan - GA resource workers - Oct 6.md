**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using 2 Web sites that we’re reviewing so we can see whether they work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the sites, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.   First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

Sherri, CAP supervisor for childcare.  I supervise Gwynnedd county.  I have 11 ppl that I supervise.  We make sure that the clients get their childcare and daycare.  We have a system that we use and we go into the system, create the tickets and make sure that the children 

Susan, Social Service Technician, foster care, assist caseworker, with things in SHINES.  Case recording.

*Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

Sherri - work on the computer for 40 hours a week, try not to use it at home.

Susan - work all the time, at home 1 hour day.

*Any favourite sites?*

Facebook  

**Site Script:**

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.  **Let’s imagine our scenario is that you are a social worker who is trying to place a child with foster parents who need daycare in order to accept the placement.*

* 	First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

 

I am seeing a place to enter a zipcode.  I would put a provider there.  You can find providers in the local area.

Is it the system that the providers are going to be set up in?  That’s all I see .

Find safe and quality child care providers in the state of mississippi.  

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?*

Yes, we do.  

*Where are you likely to be when you are doing this search?*

Usually it’s behind a desk.  But we could be behind our laptops and we do have work phones that we can use too.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

I might put the work address in.  But they may not work near home.  

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next site.  This page is interactive, so you can use your mouse to move around and interact.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

We see the map.  It looks like we see two little people on the map.  And maybe that’s the address of the daycare?  User clicks on a result, that is a foster parent.

The user is confused - thinks that we are looking at a non-relative. 

Non-Relative Out of Home: What does that mean to you?  I don’t know if that means that its one of the children’s relatives that they live with.  Not really clear.  Not sure if that’s the foster home.

Please scroll down.  It looks like it’s pulling the provider - 

Having trouble scrolling.  Do these people pertain to a particular child.  Who are they a relative and non-relative of?

Are these people connected with this child. 

What does a relative and non-relative mean?  As providers?  They are not kin to the children.  Relative is someone like an aunt keeping the child.

How would you find out more information about what this would mean?  Maybe if you click on it, you would find out who the person is to the child?

Scrolling problems with map. 

What information would you hope to see to make a good recommendation?

How it’s rated.  Some information = I would like to talk to other people who have used it.

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*

Put in a zipcode of a bordering county or bordering city, that is still close.  

Do you know those or have to look up?

I don’t know if there is any way, if you click on the name it gives you information about the home or the provider?  Give you a description of what the star ratings are.  And pictures.  

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

The layout makes sense.  I’m still unclear about the types of home.  

Licensed daycare - that stands out.  

*Is there anything that stands out as particularly helpful to your search? (map?hide/no,)*

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

*Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

In our situation, most of the time, the foster parents have their own ideas, suggestions.  

For their workers, when people pick the providers, they can go right from the start and check the daycares and they have stuff that tells about the daycare, that really help the daycare, it helps them decide where they want to put their children.  

Rightfromthestart - that’s not for foster, just for clients that apply for childcare.  

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  No.  We always go by the license.  We used to have informal providers.  We use daycares that are already licensed to take children.
