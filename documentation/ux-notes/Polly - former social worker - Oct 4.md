Hi Polly,

*Thank you so much for your willingness to speak with us again.*  *My main role here will be to give you some information up front, then to observe while you use a website that we’re currently testing. *

*	Your role is simply to use a website. We’re here today to test the website, not you! Just like last time - You can’t "fail" this test, or do anything wrong here. *

*The whole session should take at most 30 minutes. If you need to take a break at any point, please let me know.*

*	One of the best ways for you to help us during this test is to try to think out loud as much as possible. It’s particularly helpful if you tell us what you’re trying to do and what you’re looking at. It’s also helpful if you tell us when you’re confused or if something is unclear. Since our goal is to see how people use this website without someone there to guide them, I might not be able to clarify at the time, but knowing the questions you’re considering will be extremely helpful to us.*

*	You should even feel comfortable sharing these thoughts if they’re critical or harsh of the website. Please don’t worry about hurting my feelings. Remember our goal here is to find ways to improve this website, so we want to know your honest reactions.*

*	There will be some time at the end for you to ask any remaining questions, and I might ask you some questions. *

*	There are also some people observing this test on the phone. They’re here for the same reason I am: to improve the website. Don’t worry about them, they won’t be participating in the session at all, just observing.*

*	Do you have any questions so far?*

*Today, we will be working with some static images.  I’m going to ask you to play the role of social worker (or channel back to when you were in that role) in search of a daycare setting for a particular foster family in MS.   I will ask you to view one static image of a website at a time.  I will give you a task that I want you to try to complete - or more accurately, describe and use your mouse to show us how you would consider completing this task.  *

*Screen 1.*

*Please look at this screen and tell me what you would think to do on this screen.*

User goes immediately type in the zipcode of the foster parent.  It’s shorter than typing their whole address. I figure I will be able to see on the map how close the search results are to the street address of the foster parent.

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?  *No, I probably have the intake form on my desk that has it.  And I’ve been to the house - I have to go there in the first 48 hours, it’s possible that I’ve just been there.

*Where are you when you are doing this search?*  I was assuming that I was at my desk.  When I was a caseworker, I didn’t have any kind of mobile tech capabilities.  Now, even, personally, in my own life I have a personal smartphone.  I don’t know that I would try - I don’t imagine that I would pull out my homephone.  I would think I’d want a bigger screen.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

It looks like my other option is to type in the address.  I’m hoping that the zipcode is close enough that it will show some options.  If it shows visually, then I’ll know what’s quicker.  If it just shows a list - then maybe not faster.  Address might be better then.

I don’t necessarily think that I would search by the different daycare providers -  Capacity/size.  If I’m referring this person - I want to know enough info to know the difference.  [User talks about importance of the program fit with parent + child.]

Favorite would be split screen. Map + results.

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next image.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

My eye went first to the map, but the map is not very filled in.  I can’t see any streets so I don’t know where the foster parent lives on this map.  So, I’m looking at this one that’s open.  I’m thinking that it relates to the kid icon on the map.  25 miles away, in my NY frame of mind that’s way too far.  

I can narrow the search (she just does that visually).  My eye went to group home, and I thought it didn’t sound right.

Licensed day care sounds good.  

Types are confusing.  I’m going to look for the licensed day care centers.  Didn’t occur to me that I could hover. I see the numbers after them, to me the way that that’s helpful, if that’s a large number or a category I don’t recognize, I wouldn’t write it off if there are a lot of them.  

Ratings - good to know.  

If any are excellent or very good, that would stand out.

Now I’m looking at the list.  All of these are 1.5 miles away.  If the foster parent has a car, that’s not a big deal.  Now I’m clicking on the one that has a link to an outside website.  

Where I am in the process, I want to learn more.  I’m not sure how to do that with the other ones.

Now I’m noticing the stars, and I’m not sure whether I should have picked the one with most stars.  I could copy and paste into search for a provider by name box.  But that seems like - a bigger stretch for me.  I have figured out a workaround.  

Is there anything you would do with Big Sandy .. I would click the address link, but just get a map.  I would probably copy the name into google before I call them. 

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

I like how it had the map and the list.  I like that it said a that top that there are 10, so I know how long the list is.  Layout is good.  Narrow search options positioning is good.  Less than 10, do I go to another page  Looking at the right and seeing capacity - and wishing there was that info.

I would move the key up.

(User narrowed by proximity.  Then chose by link/more info, ratings.)

*Is there anything that stands out as particularly helpful to your search? (map?hide/no,)*

This question was answered in another response.  To summarize - 

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

This question was answered in another response.  User mainly focuses on distance, rating, and link for more information.

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

This question was answered in another response.  User would either do more due diligence by looking through the website or, google the provider name to see if there are online records.  Prefers this before calling.

*Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

I don’t know - I think that it depends on how crazy my day is.  I would feel better about giving foster parent a few options.  I haven’t finished my search yet.  I Want to look them up - do my due diligence.  Find some good reviews somewhere, close to foster home.  So ideally few options so we can narrow later.  If I have another family in the waiting room, I’ll find one that seems good - I will call foster parent and give them that one.  If they don’t like that one, or it’s not close enough I want some options.

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  

No.  My first thought is that I would want this to be narrowed down in that way.  In my mind, I’m distinguishing that if I had my own child, I could ask people in my neighborhood for good places that aren’t.  I don’t think I’d be comfortable doing that.  

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*

I would try to figure out if I could extend the range - this is a big range/25 miles.  Then I’m scrolling and looking to see is there one within 30 miles, can I zoom out on the map.  I’m looking at the narrow your search to see if I’ve narrowed it any way, I’m trying to expand the geographical area.  Google or yelp?

If I get stuck, I’m also going to ask my co-workers and find out where people in my agency are sending their kids to daycare.  Somebody in my building has a clue to what to do.  If there is a way to include (somehow) in the website, whether my agency is familiar that would be great to know.

==================

Questions (ref. From Rob)

1. Does the layout work?

2. How often do we want to start from the current zip code?

3. Do they want the map to always be there, or hidable, or not at all?

4. Do you want the list sorted by rating or by distance?

5. Do you want to see child care providers which are NOT financially subsidized (this is unclear to me --- do we need to add some verbiage on the site about this?)

6. Would the EVER narrow a search if there are less than 8 entries?

7. If you want to search around a different location than your current location, do you want to specify it by city, county, or zipcode?
