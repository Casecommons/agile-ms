**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using 2 Web sites that we’re reviewing so we can see whether they work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the sites, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.*

* First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

Opthalmic Technician.

* Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

	3 hours/day.  Between work/home.

* And what’s the split between email and browsing—a rough percentage?*

30/70

* What kinds of sites are you looking at when you browse the Web?  Do you have any favorite Web sites?*

Mostly do basic stuff - Facebook.  Instagram.  Pinterest.  Snapchat.  Just email.

*What types of devices do you use to browse the internet and email?*

Mostly phone.	

*Now, about your experiences with daycare.  Do you have a car?*

Yes.

*Do you have to get your kids to child care by walking or by public transportation, or would you drive?*

Drive.

*What is the furthest distance you would consider going to find child care, assuming you had a quality option available at a shorter distance?*

Work and daycare is probably 35 min, daycare to home is probably less than 10 min.  

*How did you go about deciding on the daycare?*

	Energy of the place.  Curriculum, the environment.  

*Did you look at other daycares when making your current decision?  *

	I looked at how close they were to the job.  And then visited a couple different places.

*What features do you most need to make your selection?*

	Energy, Policies, Environment, Curriculum. 

*Could you find this info online? Or did you have to go for visit?*	

	50/50.  I can’t make a decision without a visit.  I suppose I could learn about places I didn’t know about online.

*Do you care about price and hours of operation, data not provided by the state?*

	Price and operation is important.  My hours vary at work - sometimes my kids are there all day.  If they would open later, it would make a huge difference to me.  Also, I look to see if the tuition is feasible for me.  I apply for need-related discount if available.

*Site reviews script*

* 	OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.*

* 	First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

* 	You can scroll if you want to, but don’t click on anything yet.*

(User is testing on the phone)

Says Mississippi Dept of Human Services.  Wants me to put in a provider name and different info, provider type, city, county, quality star rating.

What is this?  Is this for child care?

It’s super basic and to the point.  I like basic to the point.

*Would you use this site in searching for childcare if you needed a new program?*

If I had to fill something out with this?  Probably looking for a daycare, I would probably use google instead.  I’m sorry I wouldn’t use this.  I would probably go use google maps and fill in an address and search for daycares nearby.

*For the purpose of the exercise, can you select ‘Center’ as a type and then click ‘Search.’*

*Tell me what you see there?*

Daycares. I see the phone numbers, the cities, counties, star ratings.

This list might be helpful to me.  I like the rating.  I would want to choose one with a high rating.  

**_Civic Actions Prototype script:_**

*Please look at this website and tell me what you think it’s for and what you can do.  *

This is pretty basic.  I guess I can see a list of daycares by zipcode.  I don’t understand how it knows what zipcode, but I can see that I can change the map by changing the zipcode.

It’s got some information like the name and type and status.  I could use it.  

I guess I could use this to learn about new places.  But the information is really basic.  It doesn’t have enough for me to really know much about it.  I’d have to go and google these places to find out more like curriculum, what the environment is like.

*What would you add to the site if you could do your own search?*

If I can change my own stuff, nothing really to change.  If I was going to do a search, I’d just google.  I’d look up daycares in my area and start looking at their websites.  I want to see what their hours are, where they are located, I want to see pictures of the place and see the staff.  It’s important to me that the place has a good curriculum and staff because I’m going to have my kids here for a lot of time.

**Wrapping up:**

*[their name], I think you answered all the questions I had. Is there anything I can answer for you? [pause, answer questions as needed]*

*Thank you so much for talking with me today. It was really helpful for me to hear you talk about [repeat a topic the interviewee discussed]. That’s the type of detail that is impossible for me to learn without talking to real people who are experiencing it. *

*Thanks again, and have a good rest of you day!*
