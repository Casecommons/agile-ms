**Polly.**

Late 20s.  Former social worker at a small foster care agency.  

Available to speak next week.

**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended. The session should take about an hour.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.*

* First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

*	*Former case planner and family finder for a small foster agency.  Now I work at ACS in NYC (child welfare agency) in a role where I focus on helping to ensure that service providers are meeting their quality targets.

* Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

I spend some time at work on the desktop (which works most of the time) emailing and doing some documentation.  At home, I’m on the internet a LOT.  * *

[Newly created team in Foster Care at ACS, Director of Technical Assistance.  Try to advance the strategic plan on how agencies meet their performance goals.  Just came from working at one of the provider agencies. ] 

**_Sometimes I had to fill out forms for foster parents to get money to get daycare.  They (foster parents) had already found it usually.  _**

Formerly, I was a homefinder for a very small program - about 35 families.  Don’t remember a time when we had a new placement with a foster parent where they didn’t know where to look for daycare.  Time is of the essence.  A placement happens fast - if foster parent is working, they need to get it (daycare) as soon as possible.

*When you are at work (as a social worker), how much are you in the office versus in the field?*

I was in the office a fair amount - and did home visits to all the foster homes.  Would go to each foster home once a year, for newer, would go multiple times.  2009.  

*What kind of devices do you use (at work, at home)?*

In 2009, we didn’t have any kind of smartphone or mobile device or laptop.  Just had a semi-functional desktop.  

Recently, in the agency I just came from, their case planners don’t have agency phones, they use their personal cellphones, netbooks, most of the time functioning desktop.

*What kinds of sites are you looking at when you browse the Web?  Do you have any favorite Web sites?*

*Outside of work I’m on the computer all the time - on computer, email, googling stuff.  Watch tv, online shopping, reading the news.*

*And what’s the split between email and browsing—a rough percentage? *

*	30-70.*

* *

*Didn’t ask/not relevant:*

Do you have a car?

Do you have to get your kids to child care by walking or by public transportation, or would you drive?

What is the furthest distance you would consider going to find child care, assuming you had a quality option available at a shorter distance?

How often do you need temporary child care verses ongoing child care?

*MDHS** Script*

* *

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.*

* First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

* You can scroll if you want to, but don’t click on anything yet.*

Reads the agency name and quickly understands that this is a child care search site.  She immediately understands what she’s supposed to do.

*What do you think you can do on the MDHS website?*

Seeing the provider name first, my sense is that if I already know the provider name then I would type in the name and find something out about them.

If I don’t know the name - I could pick a type, I don’t know what a slot contractor is - why is a foster care group home on here?

Going to pick a random county - there are a lot of cities in MS, so I’m going to pick Harperville, hoping I don’t pick the wrong city to county pair.

I want it to be rated 5 stars, because of course I want the best facilities.

Hmm. No records returned. 

*Do you know what the star rating means? *

Not really.  I’m hoping the 5 stars means there’s an evaluation process in place by the agency - and that the rating is the result of that process.  I would love to see the evaluation results.

This is my kid - so I really want it to be 5 stars.  So, let me change my center type - Non-relative - in home.  

Oops. No results again.

Not sure what any of the types really mean.  If I pick my county - I’ll see whether there is anything at all.  

Claybourne county - 8.  Only 2 have any stars.  Both have 4.  

Ok there we go.  Well, most of them have no stars.  Maybe they are just not rated - I’m going to hope that’s what it means, because otherwise, that’s pretty bad. 

Now I’m choosing between Heavenly Angels and Little Kids University - wish I could click a link to their website.  I could call then, but I want to know where they are - convenience of the location.

*What criteria would you use to determine who to follow up with?  *

I’m going to pick the one that is closest and - go and visit.  Tricky because the location is not here.  **If there was a map, that would be amazing. ** 

*Civic Actions prototype script*

*Please look at this site and tell me what you see, what you think you can do.  For the purpose of this exercise, ignore that the agencies are adoptive/foster care.  We will treat this as if we are trying to find out information about daycare providers.*

Well, I can see a big blank white space and then it looks like there’s some information below. I’ll scroll there.

(A few minutes later).  Oh, there’s a map.  Of coffee shops?  (Laughs) I am going to guess that this isn’t a map of the nearest Starbucks.

Scrolls back to the top.  Ok. So this is for the HHS agency in California.  I can see that this is going to be a listing of facilities in a given zipcode.  Not sure how it knew this zipcode.  But I can see that I can change it.  

*User changes zipcode.*

Oh, I have to update my profile?  Ok.  (Sounds slightly confused).

*User has a hard time navigating the map - the controller zooms in and out a lot and she’s struggling to reset.*

Ok, so I can see there are 5 licensed agencies and 2 closed.  Why are they showing closed agencies?

I’m going to click on this green +, I guess it’s going to add it to something? My list?

Oh, no, it gives me more information.

I like that this gives me capacity information.  I like that.  It helps me understand whether its a big or small facility.

*What information do you most need to make your selection?*

Well, I would prefer searching by the foster parent’s home and work address.  I can search by zipcode, but it makes me have to search more.  I’d be looking to see what are the best facilities that I can get them into that are convenient to work or home or both.

I really liked the star ratings.  I would love a link to a public scorecard.  And, if there were user reviews.  It’s hard to imagine for daycare how you can really make a selection from just a website search.

Next step for me would be to go and visit.  Or give it to the foster parents and have them go visit.

Also I want to know # of staff - which I can guess due to child/teacher ratios and capacity, but it would be helpful.  I’d also like to know whether this was a daycare in someone’s home or in a school or link to their website.

**Wrapping up:**

* 	[their name], I think you answered all the questions I had. Is there anything I can answer for you?*

* 	[pause, answer questions as needed]*

* 	Thank you so much for talking with me today. It was really helpful for me to hear you talk about [repeat a topic the interviewee discussed]. That’s the type of detail that is impossible for me to learn without talking to real people who are experiencing it. *

* 	Thanks again, and have a good rest of you day!*
