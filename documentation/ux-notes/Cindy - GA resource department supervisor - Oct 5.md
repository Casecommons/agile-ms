**Intro Script****:**

* 	Hi, Cindy. My name is Nicole, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.*

* 	Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.*

* 	You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that is being developed so we can see whether it will work as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.*

* 	The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here.*

* 	As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.*

* 	Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to help the agency support working parents, so we need to hear your honest reactions.*

* 	If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.*

*  	Do you have any questions so far?*

**Intro Questions:**

* OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.   First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day?*

I’m the supervisor in the resource development unit in Cobb County. 10 years.  Been with agency 27 years.  Adoption case manager and in this unit, we recruit train and retain foster parents.  We do sometimes get questions about what’s a good daycare.  Cobb County is a suburban area, part of metro Atlanta, we are fortunate to have quite a few childcare centers in our area.  

They are usually looking for add’l hours.  

If you’re in rural GA or MS, it might be more of challenge, here it is not so bad.  We have CAP that provides childcare for children in foster care.  There is a great network - most of the childcare centers accept CAP. 

*Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate—would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home?*

Computer usage - computer all day long.  Reading emails and responding. Usually there’s an attachment, some data to be assessed.  We also have a huge database here - that is SACWIS.  Georgia SHINES.  Working on resource development - in and out of foster parent files.  In and out of birth family files.  Occasionally - do some surfing.  My Demographic, you can guess - is older.  Not so tech savvy.  I struggle through.  I get help from millenials. 

*Our SACWIS went live on December 2008.*

*Any favourite sites?*

**Site Script:**

*OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.  **Let’s imagine our scenario is that you are a social worker who is trying to place a child with foster parents who need daycare in order to accept the placement.*

* First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.*

I see a nice blank screen - there is not a whole lot of stuff to confuse me, I will enter my zipcode and not a lot of fluff. I like that.

* *

*Do you know the zipcode off the top of your head?*

No.  But it’s in my data system, in Shines.  I also have a list that I keep handy - that has all zips in my area. I would prefer to enter the foster family address in my community - because 1 zipcode covers a vast area. If I want it as close as possible to enter their complete address.  Cut down on their travel, traffic is bad.

*Where are you likely to be when you are doing this search?*

Most likely, I’ll be right here at my desk.  But I have 4 resource development case managers.  They will most likely get this request.  They will use their agency issued cellphone.  Our foster families are very aware that I’m in the office and they can get me immediately. So, they may call me, I may get a lot.

*How does this option - starting your search from a current zipcode (39194) - align with your desire to search for daycare programs?  (Is there another way you would think to search to find the best options?)*

*Screen 2.*

*Let’s pretend that you have entered a MS zipcode on the last screen and you are directed to this next site.  This page is interactive, so you can use your mouse to move around and interact.*

*Can you tell me what you see and how you would proceed in terms of finding a daycare match for your foster family?*

I’m not familiar with the area - looks like Northern MS.  If it was my own community, I’d be familiar with it.

Doesnt’ tell me much.  Let me see what - I can see if I click on this red pin, I don’t think this would help me.  This will take me more time than I want to spend.  Put map to side, I want a written list.  I’d rather see the written information, I see Relative in home - that’s not going to help with foster kids.  That doesn’t help me.  She is available.  To save me time, show it all to me on a screen.  I may not feel comfortable referring to in home, I may feel more comfortable referring for center based.

*Can you tell me what you see under the map - *

I see the list.  Here it is!  Here you go.  Alright, there is a center based.  That’s helpful.  

*What do you want to tell the foster parents when you give them the info?*

Center based v. in home, location, and another thing that is important to foster parents is - is this a center that has experience with kids in care.  Are they familiar with CAPS program, and that there is a delay in payment.  It takes a little bit, it could be a couple of weeks before they receive first payment.  We do gravitate to daycares that we’ve dealt with.  They get the info from other foster families.  We encourage folks to talk to each other.  What your experience has been like.  Unique needs of children in care.  Esp. when they first enter care and we need people who are sensitive to it and make special plans.

*What do you think about how the information on this screen is organized?  (Does it make sense, does it help you navigate to a better match?)*

Its helpful - you get the big picture at the top.  I didn’t see that many dots on the map, but there are  a whole lot of names on the list.  Why?

I’m also curious about - a lot of times I prefer last name first, with in-home folks.  Might be easier.  Could find them quicker.

*Is there anything that stands out as particularly helpful to your search? (map?hide/no,)*

*How would you like to reorganize the results set to get a better match? (rating? distance)*

I’d like to see a way to diff between in home and center based.  Dev two separate lists.  Diff pins on the map.  

*When you find a potential match, what would you like/think to do?  *

If I’m recommending somebody - I will call, its my duty, ask some general questions about experience with kids in care, any issues (behavioral, accounting, etc.) If I had a lot of time, I would do a site visit.  I’m also going to think about the skills of the foster family - and I hope any family would be able to do the site visit themselves.  We can go onto a state sponsored site that will tell me if the center or home has any complaints or nature of complaints.  

*How do you get the results to the foster parent?  Would you try to find more than one match/possibility?*

Copy paste off of the list - I found 3 in your community and suggest they talk to them.  Give them some choice some ownership.  Chances are this is going to be a long lasting relationship.  Use for 1 child, but many.  Use for newbies.  

*If I tell you that this list only represents state-licensed or registered providers, what would you say?  Would you ever want results that aren’t on this list?*  No I do not even want to entertain the thought of putting our children in non-licensed places.  Our subsidy program CAP will not cover that.  Also, we want to make sure that our kids our safe.  They will have all the staff, curriculum. 

*Let’s imagine that you didn’t find any results that would work for your foster family, and we know that this can effect a child’s placement.  What would you do next?*

It looks like there is a filter, I would maybe if I typed in the name of the town, the map is covering a pretty wide area.  I was thinking I could say - I could type in the county, whatever county that Yazoo city is located in.
